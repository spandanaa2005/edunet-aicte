The Solar Power Prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to forecast solar power generation based on historical weather data.
The goal is to improve the accuracy of solar power predictions, enabling better grid management and renewable energy integration.
OBJECTIVE :
1. Data Collection: Gather historical weather data and solar power generation data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling.
3. Model Development: Develop and train machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict solar power generation.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the developed models using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE).
5. Model Optimization: Optimize the best-performing model by tuning hyperparameters and exploring ensemble methods.
SKILLS REQUIRED :
1. Python programming: Familiarity with Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
2. Machine learning: Knowledge of machine learning concepts, including supervised learning, regression, and model evaluation.
